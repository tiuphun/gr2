# Graduation Research 2 - Android Malware Analysis

This repository contains the results and research work done as part of the Graduation Research 2 project at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. The project focuses on Android malware analysis, specifically static analysis of Android APK files using various tools and techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this research is to explore and develop methods for identifying malicious behavior in Android applications by performing static analysis. The analysis includes the use of tools such as Androguard to disassemble, decompile, and examine the structure of APK files.

## Key Research Areas

- Static analysis of Android malware
- Identification of malicious code and behavior patterns in Android applications
- Development of a toolchain for analyzing APK files
- Techniques for overcoming obfuscation and anti-reverse engineering measures in Android apps

## Tools Used

- **Androguard**: An open-source tool for analyzing Android applications, providing capabilities like disassembly, decompilation, and static analysis.
- **JADX**: A decompiler for Android APK files, converting them into Java code.
- **APKTool**: A tool for reverse engineering Android APK files and decoding resources to their original form.
- **Python**: Used for developing scripts to automate the analysis process.
